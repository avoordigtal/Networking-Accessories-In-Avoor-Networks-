A Data network allows for exchange of data between computers beyond boundaries. Building a network requires various devices like routers, switches, servers etc. Also a lot of accessories are required to connect these devices like interface cards, cables, Optic modules, Compact Flash etc.  Not only do the devices go faulty, the accessories also go faulty and are replaced. Most of the accessories like Interface cards, Media convertors etc., can be repaired and their life extended.
